<br>

## **Description 📃**
<!-- add your game description here  -->
- 1024 is a variant of the game 2048 with several differences. In this variant, the smallest possible tile has the number 1 written on it, and the goal is to reach a tile with the number 1024. You'll go to next stage, after completing previous stage and difficulty level increases with each stage. Try it out...now!!!

## **functionalities 🎮**
<!-- add functionalities over here -->
- This puzzle can be solved in 1024 movements.
- Great Sokoban Style game with some beautifully minimalist 3D graphics and animations.
- Very well designed puzzles and challenging with Pause and Retry function.
- Definitely you gonna enjoy playing through all the stages on this one.
- That is to say, I think it is not possible to do it in less than 1024 movements.
