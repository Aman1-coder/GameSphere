### Box Merge Game

This game implements the mechanics you described:

The player controls a colored box using arrow keys.
There are several other colored boxes randomly placed in the game area.
When the player's box touches another box of the same color, they merge, and the player's box grows larger.
If the player's box touches a box of a different color, it shrinks.
The game keeps track of the score, increasing it when merging and decreasing it when shrinking.
